# MNRE-1
MNRE-1 is the original version of our dataset provided in ICME 2021.

## Data Usage
There are 10081 samples of the dataset (8 samples were removed since they are obviously incorrect due to the inconsistent tagging scheme). We split the dataset into training, development and testing set with 7824, 975 and 1282 samples, respectively.

We also provide the texts, images and the pretrained object features using [Mask RCNN](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN).

The images can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uq0Dr1RqZn-VVKe1UrG9b8xMeldYwkJs/view?usp=sharing)
